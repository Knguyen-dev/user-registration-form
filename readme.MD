-   Requirements:

*   Build a browser form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields.
*   It should use live inline validation to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in or not.
*   That means highlighting a field red and providing a helpful error message until it has been filled in properly.
*   For the sake of this lesson, make sure all of the validation occurs in the JavaScript file. Form doesn't actually need to submit, but if there are errors show them when they try to submit it. If it's successful, give user a success message. Also make sure your functions validate as the user progresses
    through the form, so hwen user leaves a field it should auto-evaluate
